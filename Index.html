            <blockquote id="Bio" cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobey_Maguire">
            <p><strong><mark>Tobias Vincent Maguire</mark></strong>(born June 27, 1975) is an American actor and film producer. He played the title character in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (2002â€“2007), and later reprised the role in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). During his childhood, Maguire entertained the idea of becoming a chef and wanted to enroll in a home economics class as a sixth grader. His mother offered him $100 to take a drama class instead, and he agreed. During many of his auditions, Maguire found himself auditioning for roles opposite another rising actor, Leonardo DiCaprio. The pair quickly became friends and made an informal pact to help each other get parts in their movies/TV shows/other projects.</p>
